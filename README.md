# Slack Notifier

This plugin will send a message to a specified Slack channel each time a short link has been added to the database.

Requires [YOURLS](https://yourls.org) `1.8.1` and above. Well, it only has been tested with this version, but there is nothing really advanced in this plugin so ... YMMV.
